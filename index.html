    <h1>climate change</h1>
    <p>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Such shifts</p>
        <p>can be natural, due to changes in the sun activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the</p>
        <p>1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the</p>
        <p>burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.</p>

        <h1>Burning fossil fuels</h1>
        <p>Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped</p>
        <p>around the Earth, trapping the sun heat and raising temperatures.</p>
        <p>The main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and</p>
        <p>methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for</p>
        <p>example. Clearing land and cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide. Agriculture,</p>
        <p>oil and gas operations are major sources of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport,</p>
        <p>buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing greenhouse gases.</p>

        <h1>Wildfires and Climate Change</h1>
        <p>Earth's warming climate is amplifying wildland fire activity, particularly in</p>
        <p>northern and temperate forests. When fires ignite the landscape, NASA</p>
        <p>satellites and instruments can detect and track them. This information helps</p>
        <p>communities and land managers around the world prepare for and respond to</p>
        <p>fires, and also provides a rich data source to help scientists better understand</p>
        <p>this growing risk.</p>
